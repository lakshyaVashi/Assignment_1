5. Convert Kilometers to Miles
Write a program that takes the distance in kilometers as input from the user
and converts it into miles using the formula:
Miles = Kilometers * 0.621371.
Code-:
import java.util.Scanner;
class K {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter distance in kilometers: ");
double km = sc.nextDouble();
double miles = km * 0.621371;
System.out.println("Distance in miles: " + miles);
}
}
