3. Power Calculation
Write a program that takes two numbers as input: a base and an exponent,
and prints the result of base raised to the exponent (without using loops or
conditionals).
Code-:
import java.util.Scanner;
class P {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter base: ");
double b = sc.nextDouble();
System.out.print("Enter exponent: ");
double e = sc.nextDouble();
double result = Math.pow(b, e);
System.out.println(b + " raised to " + e + " is " + result);
}
}
